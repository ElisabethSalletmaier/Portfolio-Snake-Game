# Portfolio-Snake-Game

SNAKE GAME: consists of 3 files: snake_main.py and snake_class.py and data.txt. The classes are imported into main.py
Python 3.10

How it works:

The game involves controlling a snakehead by turning it into 4 directions by ninety degrees until you manage to eat the blue turtle. 
When you eat the turtle, you get 1 point, the snake grows an extra body segment and a new turtle appears on the screen. 
If, or rather when, the snake bumps into the edge of the screen or accidentally eats itself the game is over and automatically starts again.
At the scoreboard you can see the highest reached score so far as well as your current score. 

only 1 player: 4 arrow buttons to controll direction "up", "down", "left", "right"
